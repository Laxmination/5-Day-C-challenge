# Loops
- A loop is used to repeat a block of code.
- Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

- Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

## Special Things
- Increment Operator
- Decrement Operator
- Infinite Loop

## While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

### Working Algorithm of while loop
- The while loop evaluates the test-expression inside the parentheses '()'.
- If test-expression is true, statements inside the body of while loop are executed. Then, test-expression is evaluated againg.
- The process goes on until test-expression is evaluated to false.
- If test-expression is false, the loop terminates (ends).

## do...while loop

The do...while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

### Working algorithm of do...while loop
- The body of do...while loop is executed once. Only then, the test-expression is evaluated.
- If test-expression is true, the body of the loop is executed againg and test-expression is evaluated once more.
- This process goes on until test-expression becomes false.
if test-expression is false, the loop ends.

## For Loop
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use for loop instead of a while loop.


### Working algorithm of for loop
- The initialization statement is executed only once.
- Then, the test-expression is evaluated. If the test-expression  is evaluated to false, the for loop is terminated.
- However, if the test-expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of the for loop are executed, and the update expression is updated.
- Again the test-expression is evaluated.
