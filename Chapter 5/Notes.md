# Function

- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and it is important for reusing code i.e. Define the code once and use it many times.
- Function only runs when it is called.
- Function is used also for dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks to make our program easy to understand and reusable.

### Properties of function
- Execution always starts from main.
- A function gets called directly or indirectly from main.
- There can be multiple functions in a program.


## Types of function
- Pre-Defined Functions 
- User-Defined Functions

## Pre-Defined Functions
- Pre-Defined Functions are inbuilt functions in C.
- The prototype and data definitions of these functions a present in their respective header files. To use these functions we need to include the header files in our program.
- Some examples of pre-defined functions are main(), printf(), scanf(), etc.


## User-Defined Functions
We can also create functions as per our need. Such Functions created by the user are known as user-defined functions.<br><br>
<b>Advantages of user-defined function:</b><br>

- The Program will be easier to understand, maintain and debug.
- We can reuse the same code just by calling the function name.
- A large program can be divided into smaller modules. Hence, a large project can be divided among any programmers.

## Methods of creating and using userdefined function
There are following methods:

- <b>Create a function: </b> To create your own function, specify the name of the function, followed by paranthesis () and curly brackets {}:<br>
Syntex :  function_type function_name(parameter1, parameter2, .......,parametern){/* Some Code*/}
