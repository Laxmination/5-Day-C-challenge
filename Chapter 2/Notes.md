## Instructions
- Instructions are statements in a program.

### Types of instructions
- Type Declaration Instruction
- Arithmetic Instructions
- Control Instructions

### Type Declaration Instructions
- These instructions are used to declare variable before using it.

### Arithmetic Instructions
- These instructions are used to do arithmetic operations. 
- Single variable on the LHS. 
- pow(x, y) for x to the power y
- Modular operator(%) returns remainder for int

### Control Instructions
- These Instructions are used to determine flow of program
- Types: Sequence Control, Decision Control, Loop Control, Case Control

### Types of Operators

- Arithmetic Operators : Used in Aruthmetic operations
- Relational Operators: Used in mathematical relations to show relation between two operands
- Logical Operators: Used to give logic between two operators
- Bitwise Operators: Used to do operations of two bits i.e. 0 and 1.
- Assignment Operators
- Ternary Operators
