## Conditional Statements
We use conditional statements to perform different actions for different decisions.<br><br>
C has following conditional statements:<br>
- Use 'if' to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
- Use 'else' to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is 'false'.
- Use 'else if' to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
- Use 'switch' to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.
